# Security-System

This is an Open source Face detection security system, using the CV2 Python module to view camera and detect faces and PyQt5 for GUI.

- I also added the ability to send emails of the picture it took to your email address so you can be notified of someone/somthing entered your room.
- I also added the ability to record footage it sees if theres a face detect, it will record for x(5) amount seconds when it doesn't detect any faces, when those x(5) amount of seconds are over, it stops to record footage.
- There is also a really nice GUI to interact with and change the face detection settings while the program is running.
- You can switch from Motion detection to face detection in run time.
- You can either use a local camera that is plugged into your computer, or connect to a camera with it's IP address
- Multi Camera does work!
  - Although the setup process is a bit tricky and crude. I will definatly be making an update to make it super easy to do it. But for the time being it will only work on Linux/Rasberry PI's. 
- This software isn't yet supported for Windows, or Mac, only Linux, after all, I designed this program to work well on any Raspberry PI.
